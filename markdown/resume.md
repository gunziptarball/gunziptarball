Experience
----------

**Software Engineer @ Cardinal Health (Fuse):**

Initially hired as a JavaScript application developer, I assumed a more 
DevOps-centric role on my team.

* Presented with an existing ETL pipeline (Python), my team was tasked with a 
large Python code base into a onto an Apache Airflow stack deployed to PCF.  
Used Packer to generate a common development environment so Windows and MacOS 
engineers could work side-by-side.  Built concourse CI/CD pipeline.  The team 
was able to continue development uninterrupted during refactor, and is still 
able to maintain the existing stack all while the modernization effort.

* Actively involved with org-wide initiative to define current and new 
infrastructure using Terraform.  As an early adopter, my team was able to take 
advantage of the self-service nature of *IaC* while improving transparency of 
our project's AWS usage.

* Frequent contributor to our internal Chef repository to unblock my team due to 
configuration management needs.

* Facing a potentially weeks-long OCR project, designed a workflow with Celery 
that was deployed to scale on an Apache Mesos platform.

* Introduced test automation to existing data ingest pipeline built around Kafka 
and MemSQL.  Developed additional apps with Kafka Streams, deployed to PCF.
