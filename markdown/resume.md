Professional Experience
-----------------------

**Software Engineer @ Cardinal Health (Fuse):**  Jan, 2014 &mdash; Current

Initially hired as a JavaScript application developer, I assumed a more 
DevOps-centric role on my team.

* Presented with an existing ETL pipeline (Python), my team was tasked with a 
large Python code base into a onto an Apache Airflow stack deployed to PCF.  
Used Packer to generate a common development environment so Windows and MacOS 
engineers could work side-by-side.  Built concourse CI/CD pipeline.  The team 
is able to continue development uninterrupted during refactor, and is still 
able to maintain the existing stack all while the modernization effort.

* Actively involved with org-wide initiative to define current and new 
infrastructure using Terraform.  As an early adopter, my team was able to take 
advantage of the self-service nature of *IaC* while improving transparency of 
our project's AWS resource usage (cost).

* Frequent contributor to our internal Chef repository to unblock my team due to 
configuration management needs.

* Facing a potentially weeks-long OCR project, designed a workflow with Celery 
that was deployed to scale on an Apache Mesos platform.

* Introduced test automation to existing data ingest pipeline built around Kafka 
and MemSQL.  Developed additional apps with Kafka Streams, deployed to PCF.

* Deployed a VPC in AWS with Terraform including EC2 instances for Kafka and 
MemSQL clusters.  Authored an internal Chef cookbook to provision MemSQL 
installation.

**Sr. GIS Developer @ City of Memphis (contractor):**  Aug, 2013 &mdash; Jan, 2014

* Embedded ArcGIS JavaScript API in Ember.js application.
* Exposed basic Agile/Scrum concepts to the team.
* Introduced TDD/BDD practices to fellow engineers.

**Sr. GIS Developer @ FedEx (contractor):**  Nov, 2012 &mdash; Aug, 2013

* Extended ArcGIS JavaScript API to provide custom interactive map layer when 
  out-of-the-box features were not available. 
* Designed Node.js test harness/proxy and basic unit test suite (Karma/Jasmine) 
  to decouple front-end development from backend dependency.  This allowed 
  developers to build the application without the requirement of running local 
  JEE web server, drastically improving efficiency by reducing test feedback 
  cycle time.
  

**Sr. GIS Developer @ BNSF Railway (contractor)**  May, 2011 &mdash; Nov, 2012

* Built ETL / Geoprocessing workflows (Python) to prepare mapping data for use 
in ArcGIS Schematics project.  This included the use of spatial SQL queries, 
linear referencing and topologies.
* Lead on developing and supporting multiple JavaScript web mapping applications 
serving operations and engineering personnel.  One application built using 
Google Maps API.
* Managed aspects of ArcSDE geodatabase running against DB2 Spatial Extender.

**GIS Programmer and Cartographer @ University of Memphis:**  Sep, 2007 &mdash; Apr, 2011

* Authored maps representing a variety of data elements, including parcel, 
real estate, crime, public resources, transportation, education and census 
demographics. 
* Designed automation around statistical reporting, mostly around foreclosure 
activity during the 2008 housing crisis. 
* Built web scrapers (Python) to crawl the public record.
* Tailored composite address locators to provide highly accurate geocoding 
  output.
